  # Getting Started  
  
.varl basically is "key = value"  data format. As example:

    full name = Athaariq Ardhiansyah

That's it... but, actually you can [do more](https://github.com/Thor-x86/varl/blob/master/docs/2-Data_Types.md) than that.

## Comment

.varl also provides comment feature. For example:

    * This is a comment!
    * the program won't read this, only for humans :)
